## How to use

Start the addon and use Ingress for initial configuration.

For external access you can setup another user, or change the password of the user `homeassistant`.

## Configuration

### Access and setup

By default access is available through Ingress. For external access you need to set a port in addon settings.

### Credentials

One user, `homeassistant`, is created with a random password on first launch. This user will automatically be logged in when you access through Ingress. If removed, the account will be recreated on next restart. You are free to change the password, this will not affect access through Ingress.

### Camera

mjpg-streamer is available for camera and snapshots. There are issues with the remote proxy and Ingress, to have a video feed you need it to be able outside of Ingress. This is not the case for snapshots, which is pre-configured.

`gphoto2` is also available, for using a [DSLR with OctoLapse](https://github.com/FormerLurker/Octolapse/wiki/V0.4---Configuring-a-DSLR). The script is located at `/scripts/take_snapshot.sh`, note the `_` instead of `-` (dash) in the filename.

### Slicer

To connect an external slicer such as Cura to OctoPrint you need to set a port for WebUI in addon settings. It is **not** possible to connect through Ingress.

CuraEngine 15.04.6 is pre-installed. To use it, install the plugin [CuraEngine Legacy](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/curalegacy/).

### Klipper

This addon comes with Klipper pre-installed. To use it, install the plugin OctoKlipper. *Note that this addon will **not** change the firmware of the printer, you are required to do that setup separately*.
The config option `autostart_klipper` lets Klipper autostart, instead of manually starting from within OctoPrint.
Linux host process is available, intended for using a [Raspberry Pi as a secondary MCU](https://www.klipper3d.org/RPi_microcontroller.html). *Not working as intended*.

#### Moonraker

Moonraker is installed but not configured. Suggestions on configuration are welcome.

### Updates

First make a backup from within OctoPrint.
Updates of OctoPrint should be possible from inside the addon.

### Backups

A backup from within OctoPrint should be sufficient, as it will include both OctoPrint and Klipper configuration files.

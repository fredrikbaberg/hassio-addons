# OctoPrint add-on for Home Assistant

**This version is highly experimental!**
**Ensure you have backup of your configuration, the same config folder is used for all versions. Plugins are most likely not kept between updates.**


This version has been unavailabe for some time due to an old configuration, I've been hesistant to update since it could break.
Now there has been some time, so I'll experiment with this version instead of "slim" or "dev". This will be limited to newer versions of Home Assistant (0.108.0 for now, arbitrary number and mostly a safeguard - I do not plan to work on backwards-compatibility). Expect breaking changes, and do make a **backup** before updating.

## Setup

No configuration is passed through from the options.
Preferred method is through Ingress, which does not require you to enter credentials.
A default user is created, and will be re-created if removed/renamed, but the password should be changed if you allow external access.
For external access, make sure to set a password and then specify a port.

## Versions

Some notes regarding the software and versions.
Not all software is installed for all images.

- OctoPrint
Installed in a virtualenv from pypi. Image is built with a pre-defined version of OctoPrint, this is set and triggered by the developer. However, it should now be possible to update from within OctoPrint.

- Cura
Legacy version is needed in order to use Cura as slicer in OctoPrint. There is a plugin in OctoPrint for legacy Cura, which probably has to be installed for this to work.

- PyBonjour
Is not available from pypi, so installed from external source. There has been no investigation as to if discovery works with regards to port configuration.

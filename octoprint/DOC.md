# Documentation

All configuration should be done using OctoPrint WebUI.

## Access

There is a default user created called `homeassistant`, this is for access through Ingress. At first launch you should change the password for this user.

In case you want to be able to access OctoPrint without using Ingress, specify the port in the port section of the addon.
